      "challenge for news articles is that due to journalistic and editorial constraints and traditions, many news outlets will bury minor tidbits of information that don't warrant their own articles as \"in other news\" addendums or asides at the end of or within an unrelated article. For example, a roundup article about the latest developments in Ukraine might include a single sentence commenting that today the US Federal Reserve reported that inflation is climbing. Similarly, a long-form discussion of the latest on US-China relations might discuss protests in Hong Kong with a single sentence or two relaying the latest on events in Iran.Even more commonly, the widely varying editorial standards of news outlets and the \"voice\" of their journalists and columnists can pose unique challenges to embedding-based similarity.

For example, select a single article about a major news event and transitively follow its similarity edges out several levels to arrive at an instant cluster of coverage about that story across countries and languages. One challenge in such clustering lies in how to handle \"bridge articles\" which connect clusters. For example, one cluster of stories might detail the Biden-Putin summit, while another cluster focuses on Biden's domestic agenda before Congress. A bridge article might discuss both stories and how they relate, connecting the two clusters as it is equally similar to articles in both clusters. How to handle such bridge articles depends on the specific application. Some applications might wish to discard bridge articles, assign them to both clusters without connecting the clusters\n",
